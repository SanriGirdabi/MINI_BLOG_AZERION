# Mini-Blog-Azerion
This is a demo app, made for the application procedure Azerion.<br>
There is a language confusion, I've started the app in Turkish and during the development procedure, I've switched to English.
If consisteny on language is asked, I can change it, however I'm leaving it like that for now. I keep it simple and didn't spend to much time
on the Frontend, everything has been Bootstrapped.
